OCrime integrates sex scenes in the world in two ways:

- Having sex in public is illegal in all holds and will net you a 200 gold (configurable) fine if caught by a guard. Additionally the guards will walk up to you and break up your OStim scene.

- OStim scenes now make noise events so NPCs can hear them. They will look your way if they hear a scene. Additionally, if a bandit or someone similar  hears someone having sex that they don't recognize, they will start investigating.

Both of these apply to you and all NPCs.

The crime detection code is fairly smart. If you are for example just performing a kiss through ORomance, even though that is technically an OStim scene it will not be marked as a crime. Furthermore other checks are in place to make sure private scenes are not marked as public/illegal.
